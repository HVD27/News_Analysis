After truck drivers' strike Govt agrees to discuss! Satish Acharya,"level 1AditiiSen Â· 4 hr. agoThis law is not a bad law at all. But the implementation is a major problem. Also, mob lynching is a problem. A country like India where it is always the fault of the bigger vehicle owner and where people randomly cross the road without checking left and right and definitely not the signals.In a country like India, you can't pass a law and expect it to change the people at once. Also, as Indians we need to change and do better if we expect our country to do better.The law passed is a step in the right direction but they need to also have provision if there is a mob ready to beat the driver then the driver can drive to a police station and surrender. That should be an acceptable situation as well.Also, make sure all the drivers have attained their license in the proper manner. Have better driving license test and a traffic police force who are actually there to maintain traffic and help people and not there to make money but showing their uniform.125ReplyShareReportSaveFollow

This is the case for multiple laws in the 3 build that were passed, but only the laws that get massive protests are likely to be discussed and possibly fixed.

I don't care about the parliament part right now but the truck drivers protesting is not out of nowhere. Truck drivers are far more vulnerable than we realise, a significant amount of trucks operate on roads which have dense traffic. And people in the road drive like that have 9 lives. Truck drivers are often killed or beaten up even if they are not at fault. So they have reason to be concerned. It did happen with our truck too and our driver was almost beaten up but was saved by others in the spot.1ReplyShareReportSaveFollow

level 1rishianandOp Â· 6 hr. agoGandhian SocialistBharatiya Nyaya Samhita (BNS), along with Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita (BNSS) and Bharatiya Sakshya Act (BS), was passed in Lok Sabha on 20 December and in Rajya Sabha on 21 December, and received President's assent on 25 December 2023, to replace the Indian Penal Code, Criminal Procedure Code, and Indian Evidence Act. These critical bills saw little debate in the Parliament, which was forcibly captured by the ruling party after suspending 143 opposition members. BNS introduced several key changes to the penal code which would allow a de-facto Police Raj in the country, among other provisions.On January 1, protests against BNS broke off across the country from the transport workers. The workers were protesting against the increase in punishment and fine under the new law. The public and freight transport came to a halt. On January 3, MHA released a statement, saying that the newly passed Bhartiya Nyaya Samhita (BNS) has not yet come into effect, and the Government will hold discussions with the transport union regarding the contentious provisions.The entire episode is yet another example of the senseless and undemocratic policymaking under Modi Government. Modi Government has a colonial attitude towards India. They do not believe in any debate or discussion. They hold a dim view and understanding of parliamentary democracy. They routinely ignore the advice of scientists, academicians, and activists. They have little concern or care about common citizens. And they believe that increasing punishment or using force will fix any problem.From demonetization, to lockdown, to farm laws, to labour laws, to digital surveillance laws, to BNS, Modi Government has created a habit of taking senseless and undemocratic decisions and causing suffering for the common citizens and the nation. Had the policy been properly discussed and debated before, instead of discussing it after being passed, the strike could have been averted.Transport Worker's Strike and the Swift About-Face by the Modi Government is Yet Another Example of the Thoughtless and Undemocratic Policy Making Under this Regime-1ReplyShareReportSaveFollow

RSTV is only showing treasury benches.https://twitter.com/Memeghnad/status/1737757374243618823As truckers are protesting against the #HitandRunLaw, useful to remember that in the re-introduced version of Bhartiya Nyaya Sanhita 'causing death by rash and negligent act' attracted 5 years imprisonment for doctors as well (in cases of medical negligence).However, as per Home Minister Amit Shah's speech in #LokSabha, the Indian Medical Association managed to successfully undertake advocacy to get this reduced to two years, for which Home Minister moved official amendment just before the Bill was passed by LS.IMA had access to the Home Minister, Truckers are protesting on the street. In a #democracy, access to making and influencing law should be equitable and not restricted to a few elites.In fact, this is the reason that Standing Committees invite comments from public on Bills. But, the Home Affairs Standing Committee DID NOT invite comments on the three #criminalbills and rushed through with the process of scrutiny of the Bills. And ofcourse, the Bills were debated by both Houses in absence of most Opposition MPs, further reducing the possibilities of critical analysis.This is not how laws are supposed to be made!https://twitter.com/maadhyam/status/1742165710040932802?t=zSjSatOVmtG8tBJScVDgag&s=19264 questions raised by suspended Opposition MPs deleted from recordshttps://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/264-questions-raised-by-suspended-opposition-mps-deleted-from-records-101703272812489.html1ReplyShareReportSaveFollow

These perspectives provide a diverse range of opinions on the law, its implementation, and the broader implications for society and governance in India.","Certainly, here are some insights that a political candidate might consider:

1. **Implementation is Key:** AditiiSen's point about the importance of implementation resonates with the need for effective governance. A political candidate could emphasize the importance of not just passing laws but ensuring they are implemented efficiently. This could involve advocating for reforms in law enforcement and administrative processes to ensure the laws have the desired impact on the ground.

2. **Clear Communication:** Socratichuman's concern about articulation highlights the need for clear communication of government policies. A candidate could stress the importance of transparency and effective communication with the public to build trust. This may involve ensuring that legal language is accessible to the public and actively engaging in dialogue to address concerns.

3. **Tackling Corruption:** The humorous remark by hydrosalad about employment tied to poorly articulated laws suggests concerns about corruption. A candidate could focus on anti-corruption measures, promising a transparent and accountable administration. Highlighting plans for judicial and law enforcement reforms might resonate with voters.

4. **Realistic Legislation:** The criticism from charavaka emphasizes the importance of considering ground realities when drafting legislation. A candidate might promise to ensure that laws are practical, taking into account the diverse challenges faced by the population. Engaging in thorough discussions in parliament and seeking expert opinions before passing laws could be part of this approach.

5. **Public Priorities:** The mention of selective protests on the telecom bill suggests that public attention is selective. A political candidate may need to understand and address the public's concerns effectively, even if they aren't receiving widespread attention. This involves being aware of the broader legislative landscape and communicating effectively about the candidate's stance on various issues.

6. **Mob Lynching Concerns:** AditiiSen's concern about mob violence highlights a need for law and order reforms. A candidate might advocate for measures to ensure the safety of individuals involved in accidents, emphasizing the importance of protecting innocent drivers from potential harm and promoting a fair and just legal system.

7. **Fault Determination:** The skepticism about determining fault in accidents raises questions about the legal process. A candidate could focus on ensuring a fair and efficient legal system, potentially proposing reforms in how accident investigations are conducted and fault is determined, to avoid potential miscarriages of justice.

8. **Parliamentary Debate:** The criticism from charavaka regarding the lack of proper parliamentary debate underscores the importance of democratic processes. A candidate could commit to upholding democratic principles, ensuring thorough discussions on key issues, and actively seeking public input before passing significant legislation.

9. **Protests as Democratic Expression:** The debate about the legitimacy of protests suggests a divided opinion on this issue. A candidate could take a balanced approach, acknowledging the value of peaceful protests as a democratic expression while also emphasizing the importance of parliamentary debates and discussions to address grievances systematically.

In summary, a political candidate should focus on effective governance, transparent communication, anti-corruption measures, realistic legislation, understanding public priorities, law and order reforms, fair legal processes, upholding democratic principles, and recognizing the value of both protests and parliamentary debates. Tailoring these insights to specific local or national contexts will be crucial for a successful political campaign.","1. **Implementation Challenges (AditiiSen):**

level 5BigWetRasogolla Â· 19 hr. agoUSA <-> West BengalYou know how much truck drivers in the US are paid? Mind that these people are the very hardworking and will do everything. American work hours are so less for themSo I actually grew up in the U.S. and worked for a transportation logistics company in college. Some truck drivers--especially those who own their own vehicles--can make well over $100,000 per year.However, the interstate trucking industry is actually quite well-regulated, both at the state level and at the federal level. Under most circumstances, it would be borderline impossible for an undocumented immigrant to obtain a commercial driver's license (CDL). And, for business owners, the risks of detection simply aren't worth the reward.Anyway, was just addressing the point about truck drivers. I get where you're coming from, but some of these seemingly ""low-skill, high-pay"" positions have higher (legal) barriers to entry than you'd probably expect.14ReplyShareReportSaveFollow

level 6TheLastSamurai101 Â· 10 hr. agoThis is not how sanctuary cities/states work if that's what you're talking about. Sanctuary cities are just cities where the local police don't get involved in actively reporting or catching illegal immigrants or cooperate with operations against illegal immigrants. They argue that it is actually not their job to do so anyway, but legally the responsibility of the immigration authorities and federal police. The purpose is so that illegal immigrants aren't afraid to access things like legal, social, educational and health services for fear of deportation.Republicans have created this false narrative that santuary cities actively protect illegal immigrants from the immigration authorities, but that is not true. ICE can still operate freely within places like New York City, investigate however they like and catch whoever they want. It is just that the NYC police and the NY state police won't help them. But they certainly won't hinder them either.6ReplyShareReportSaveFollow

Even for people in our position, obtaining a visa isn't exactly easy. So far as I recall, it takes between 1.5 and 2.5 years from start to finish.I was lucky: our case met the Department of State's criteria for consular processing, and it was adjudicated in less than two months. But such requests are very rarely granted, and many families have to live separately--one spouse in India, the other in the U.S.--until all formalities have concluded.And then, on the other hand, I have Indian friends who don't have permanent residency after having spent between 10 and 15 years in the United States.

level 7BigWetRasogolla Â· 11 hr. agoUSA <-> West BengalSo consular processing itself isnâ€™t very time-consuming â€”itâ€™s all the formalities that come before and after.The worst step is, by far, the worst. Every immigrant visa application must be preceded by the submission of Form I-130. This application is sent to the United States and reviewed by U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, which makes a determination and forwards its decision to the Department of State.Processing times vary, with different USCIS field offices having wildly different averages. Some centers take a year, others take closer to two. Itâ€™s all luck (or lack thereof).After Form I-130 has been processed, it only takes another few monthsâ€”up to a half-yearâ€”to complete all other formalities.My wife and I went through â€œdirect consular filing,â€ or DCF. In DCF, the consulate itself reviews and adjudicates Form I-130 (along with the subsequent documentation that would typically be reviewed by the National Visa Center). Most of the time, DCF can be completed within a matter of weeks. Our case only took as long as it did because we were also planning our social wedding (weâ€™d had a registry marriage the year before).However, very, very few people get to go through DCF. You have to meet specific requirements, and the decision to accept or deny a request is entirely at the consulateâ€™s discretion.2ReplyShareReportSaveFollow

1. **Desire for Prestige and Validation:** Some individuals may be driven by a desire for prestige and validation, seeking a perceived higher status by immigrating to the USA. The Gujrati community, in particular, is mentioned to have a penchant for living together and maintaining a homogeneous community, contributing to the motivation for immigration.

   > ""Yes but living in the USA carries prestige you cannot otherwise buy. And these people crave that prestige.""

2. **Challenges in India:** Despite financial means, some argue that the quality of life in India is compromised due to issues like poor infrastructure, air pollution, and the overall quality of everyday items. This perspective suggests that having money in India may not guarantee a comfortable life.

   > ""One thing I've realized is that lots of people, even with money, cannot get luxury in India.""

3. **Perceived Better Opportunities Abroad:** There is a perception among some individuals that life in the USA, even in lower-paying jobs, is better than the prospects they have in India. This perspective may stem from the belief that opportunities for growth and quality of life are higher abroad.

   > ""They genuinely believe being a toilet-scrubber in the US is better than working in any capacity in India.""

4. **Motivation for Illegal Immigration:** The discussion touches upon the possibility that individuals may be motivated by the hope of a better life in the USA, even resorting to illegal immigration. The reasons include the desire for better job prospects, living conditions, and the pursuit of the American dream.

   > ""Each of them admitted that they had agreed to","Certainly, I can provide some insights based on the perspectives presented:

1. **Prestige and Validation:**
   - **Insight:** While the desire for prestige and validation is understandable, it's crucial for the political candidate to address the root causes of this aspiration. Emphasizing policies that promote inclusivity, cultural diversity, and community integration can help build a sense of belonging and recognition for all residents, regardless of their background.

2. **Challenges in India:**
   - **Insight:** Recognizing the challenges faced in India, the political candidate can advocate for policies that address issues such as infrastructure development, pollution control, and healthcare improvements. Promoting sustainable and eco-friendly practices, along with investments in public services, can enhance the overall quality of life for residents.

3. **Perceived Better Opportunities Abroad:**
   - **Insight:** It's essential to communicate the candidate's vision for creating opportunities and improving the standard of living within the country. Focusing on economic growth, job creation, and skill development programs can instill confidence among citizens that their aspirations can be fulfilled domestically without resorting to illegal means.

4. **Motivation for Illegal Immigration:**
   - **Insight:** Understanding the motivation for illegal immigration involves addressing the push factors in India. The political candidate should advocate for comprehensive immigration policies, economic reforms, and diplomatic efforts to create a conducive environment for legal avenues of migration. Additionally, promoting awareness about the risks and consequences of illegal immigration is crucial.

In summary, the political candidate should focus on creating an inclusive and prosperous environment domestically, addressing the root causes of migration aspirations, and promoting legal avenues for individuals to achieve their goals. This approach aligns with building a sustainable and thriving society while respecting the diverse aspirations of its citizens.","**Analysis of Perspectives:**

The conversation suggests that these transformations occurred after 2016 and were not solely due to political affiliations, emphasizing the role of specific leaders in regional development.

   > ""Naveen Patnaik has been in power for over 20 years but these places started developing after 2016... His party didn't really care about western Odisha region until the centre started eyeing it for rare earth minerals recently.""

BJP win in Indiaâ€™s 2024 general election â€˜almost an inevitabilityâ€™,"level 1lonelytunes09 Â· 9 hr. agoWhile the the article talks about Hindutva only, BJP's core voter base of Hindutva(who vote for Hindutva alone) is not more than 15-20%. A major part of the voter is the beneficiary of social benefit schemes. While most of the people on social media and these journalist are well to do, people do not realize how a small benefit like gas cylinder, tap water or toilet is to people who are living below or close to the poverty line.Also what differentiates modi from other leaders is the scale at which feedback is collected and branding is done. While media and this ads are visible, these are very low contributors to the popularity. The major contributors are the karyakartas on the ground who are in touch with people and spend their time communicating one-to-one. The biggest example is GST. While BJP's core voter base is termed as brahman, baniya i.e. trader and upper caste community, they took courageous decision of implementing GST which Congress could not do for the fear of losing support from cash cows. There was a back lash from the business community however, even the opposition could not expose this fault line because BJP had ears to the ground and agility to adapt to the changes.This is the difference between BJP and Congress. While BJP hammers on every faultline of Congress, Congress expects that BJP faultline to be exposed on their own. There is a phrase in my mother tongue which roughly translates to 'if there is god, I would get food even lying on my bed' and that is the general attitude of Congress.123ReplyShareReportSaveFollow
level 2chiguy_1 Â· 2 hr. agoWait, BJP is winning because of ""social benefit schemes""? But don't BJP supporters rage against freebies day and night? So are freebies good or are they bad?Plus, the claim about their core voter base being only 15-20% hindutva is not correct. If it was so, why is the government preparing to demolish mosques in Varanasi and Mathura? Why is demolishing people's houses celebrated? Why are riots being conducted in Manipur? Why does BJP give tickets to more and more extremists in every state?In Karnataka elections, BJP fought elections on the sole issue that ""Congress insulted lord Hanuman. We will win elections because lord Hanuman is with us."" If their core hindutva vote bank is only 15-20%, why did they fight elections solely on this issue?8ReplyShareReportSaveFollow
level 3lonelytunes09 Â· 53 min. agoThere is a stark difference between freebie and social benefit scheme and the difference is targeted social benefit to the beneficiary.While giving free electricity to people who can pay for it achieves no social benefit but giving free bus rides to women them mobility and ability to earn for themselves and family.Now the second part is ensuring the social benefit is given to the right beneficiary by penetrating several corrupt inefficient beareaucratic layers. Modi takes credit for that. All the while kcr had best social benefit programmes from cradle to grave however, people complained that they did not receive the benefits.Hindutva is just a common platform for interaction as I had given an example earlier. The business class would had pulled the rug under BJP's feet had they not addressed their concerns of GST. In such a case no appeal for sake of Hindutva will work. In my experience an uneducated poor man is more savvy and informed of politics than an educated person because there is an existential crisis which hinges on his vote. He might listen to you on the Hindutva agenda but will only vote if you address his concerns.5ReplyShareReportSaveFollow
level 2deepsmooch69 Â· 6 hr. ago Â· edited 6 hr. agoI am sorry but for all of these strengths, by far the biggest strength of BJP is how they have destroyed institutions who are supposed to keep a check on the power. As a result they are literally free to do whatever they like - they can spin the news however they like because the media is pliant, and because the media is plaint BJP makes sure that the agency which is supposed to keep a check on the news channels does not do its job, they can offer plum rajya sabha position to retiring judges - a clear conflict of interest and would be unacceptable in any other half decent working democracy, they have legitimised opaque funding in the form of electoral bonds from crony corporates and gets a lion share of political donations, the public does not know who donated and why,  they might loose state elections but on the back of central investigating agencies and sheer money power topple a democratically elected state government and change it to BJP, centrally appointed LG's in various non BJP state governments have been known to disrupt the state government's working, if the highest court disagrees with constitutional authority overreach by LG and returns a judgement in favor of the state government such as in Delhi, an ordinance is passed with in a week which renders a democratically elected government with no powers what so ever, they control the social media narrative by intimidating social media companies so the truth literally has no space to come out, they force alliance with the same people they called anti nationals or deeply corrupt and all of that is forgotten when they join BJP, the opposition and the common man has literally no voice left in the media in India so while it is easy to blame opposition for not doing enough, the fact is that they just cannot. I can go on and on but give this amount of power to any party, even a brand spanking new party and you will see their performance in elections.The worse part is not even that BJP is doing all of this and getting away, the worse part is that this will become a template for being in power in the times to come in India. Please go back in time and see how our politics has bascially gone down hill successively every 5 years - from ruthlessly honest Lal Bahadur Shastri to Election commission which had the balls to call of Indira Gandhi's election or the erstwhile BJP government which lost lok sabha election because of onion prices, we have seen the power of pulbic erode in Indian democracy.

Certain sections of society are getting their needs and aspirations fulfilled.But my intuition says that this development is lopsided and will come at a huge cost for India. In the coming years there could be revolts and political upheaval.There is a threshold to fake sense of identity that nationalism can provide and religion cannot feed a hungry stomach.Opposition owes to the citizens, if they don't stand up for people, people will stand up for themselves and that will be unmanageable and angry force.

The Political wave that was there in early 2010s got strengthened even further when this Resource intensive vector got acquired by the Incumbemt.In macro terms (& historic when it will be written about decades from now), Opposition actually has punched ABOVE its weight & capacity given the scale & scope of asymmetry and challenges. What one should/would have expected is INC to be in single-digit vote & seat shares or 0 (as the Intention, even xyz-mukt-bharat messaging explicitly was) but it's not, objectively so.Until 2021-22, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) was the biggest beneficiary of electoral bonds, receiving Rs 5,272 crore in donations or 57% of the total value of bonds, according to data from the Association of Democratic Reforms (ADR). The Congress received the second highest amount of Rs 952 crore (10% of the total amount)Rs 16,000 crore in 6 years: Electoral bonds spiked ahead of key elections.It's pretty simple, UNLESS one wants it to be bending over backwards mental gymnastics complicated for whatever reasons.3ReplyShareReportSaveFollow

level 1Upstuck_Udonkadonk Â· 15 hr. agoCentre leftYeah there would have been a chanc",data5.csv,"1. **Analysis of BJP's Voter Base:** The discussion involves an analysis of BJP's voter base, highlighting that while the party's core supporters are associated with Hindutva, a significant portion of voters is attracted by social benefit schemes. The effectiveness of ground-level communication by BJP's karyakartas is emphasized, citing examples like GST, where the party addressed concerns of the business community.

   > ""A major part of the voter is the beneficiary of social benefit schemes... The major contributors are the karyakartas on the ground who are in touch with people and spend their time communicating one-to-one.""

2. **Contrasting Views on BJP's Success:** A commenter questions the claim that BJP's core voter base is only 15-20% Hindutva, pointing to issues like mosque demolitions and extremist elements. This leads to a debate about the perceived role of Hindutva in BJP's electoral strategy and the contradictory stance on social benefit schemes.

   > ""But don't BJP supporters rage against freebies day and night? So are freebies good or are they bad?... If their core Hindutva vote bank is only 15-20%, why did they fight elections solely on this issue?""

3. **Dissenting View on BJP's Strengths:** Another perspective highlights concerns about the BJP's impact on institutions and accuses them of weakening checks and balances. The commenter argues that BJP's success is tied to dismantling institutions, media manipulation, and opaque political funding through electoral bonds.

   > ""by far the biggest strength of BJP is how they have destroyed institutions who are supposed to keep a check on the power... The worse part is that this will become a template for being in power in the times to come in India.""

4. **Government Control and Opposition Challenges:** A discussion ensues about the perceived central control over state governments and instances where governors allegedly disrupt the functioning of state governments. This leads to concerns about the weakening of democratic processes and the challenges faced by the opposition.

   > ""Again, you specifically said that Centre can 'topple' State... A weak opposition that didn't stand with the people would be at fault.""

5. **Mixed Views on BJP's Development Narrative:** Views on the ground-level impact of BJP's development initiatives are presented, with contrasting opinions. While some appreciate infrastructure development and positive changes, others express concerns about the perceived concentration of power and potential long-term consequences.

   > ""People can actually feel and see the infrastructure development by the central govt... The common man feels more secure with Modi at the helm.""

6. **Discontent with Congress:** There is a shared sentiment of discontent towards the Congress, with a commenter expressing strong disappointment. The perception is that the Congress lacks political courage and is not living up to its liberal and secular claims.

   > ""I find myself disgusted with Congress even more than the BJP... The true matter of shame is that the liberal and secular party is decidedly not liberal and secular.""

7. **Calls for a Strong Opposition:** There is a common acknowledgment of the need for a stronger opposition to provide a viable alternative. Criticisms are directed at the current state of opposition parties, with a hope for a more visionary and effective political force.

   > ""We desperately need a better opposition... Let's hope the Congress finally splits and throws these Gandhi's out after 2024.""

8. **Concerns about Multi-Party Government:** In discussing potential scenarios if BJP were to lose, concerns are raised about the challenges of forming a multi-party government, anticipating difficulties in decision-making and potential instability.

   > ""BJP losing will be much bigger shitshow as Congress would never get full majority... No major decision will be implemented because of the multi-party government.""

9. **Skepticism about Democracy's Health:** The potential scenario of BJP losing prompts a reflection on the state of democracy in India. There is skepticism about the health of democracy, considering the challenges and uncertainties associated with diverse political scenarios.

   quote > ""History will be kinder to me than the contemporary media or the opposition for that matter."" - Dr. Manmohan Singh

   quote > ""I feel that what we have now we owe to dynastic politics.""

   quote > ""BJP is bigger on dynastic politics than Congress.""

3. **Media and Political Transparency:** The discussions highlight concerns about media influence and political transparency. There's skepticism about the current Prime Minister's accessibility to the media, with mentions of controlled press conferences and pre-approved questions. Some express a desire for open press conferences, contrasting the current situation with Dr. Manmohan Singh's willingness to face challenging questions.

   quote > ""Is there a point in having a press conference? Even if he holds one it will be sanitized...""

   quote > ""Cuz the reporters were never allowed inside.""

   quote > ""But he was the one who had the guts to face sharp questions from media.""

4. **Critique of Current Political Climate:** There is criticism of the current political climate, with discussions on the perceived decline in the stature of the Prime Minister's position. Some express concerns about the handling of opposition members in parliament and the overall state of democracy.

   quote > ""What's more fucked than suspending any and every opposition member from parliament just for asking 'how this happened.'""

   quote > ""I wish lot more people join reddit and get rid of bjp.""

   quote > ""Maybe, just maybe, we would still have him if he was unbound and did what he would have wanted to.""

5. **Diverse Perspectives on Political Figures:** The discussions include diverse views on political figures, including praise for Dr. Manmohan Singh's integrity and leadership style, criticism of the current Prime Minister, and debates about the suitability of leaders from various political parties.

   quote > ""Massive respect to Dr Manmohan Singh.""

   quote > ""I miss his sanity.""

   quote > ""He faced challenges in congress bcoz arresting on questioning was not the culture at that time.""

6. **Sociopolitical Observations:** There are sociopolitical observations, including discussions on the impact of religion, regional sentiments, and public perception on political narratives.

   quote > ""Gujarat - Gaay hamari maata hai, iske aage kuch nahi aata hai.""

   quote > ""I still believe it's 80% congress' fault and only 20% BJPs doing.""

   quote > ""A technocrat is better than having a demagogue who cannot even answer 1 unscripted question on his record...""

These perspectives provide a glimpse into the diverse opinions and concerns within the online community, reflecting broader discussions on politics, leadership, and sociopolitical dynamics.","Certainly, here are insights based on the perspectives discussed:

1. **Desire for Prestige and Validation:**
   - **Insight:** Recognize the importance of addressing the desire for prestige and validation among certain communities. A political candidate could focus on policies and initiatives that contribute to community pride and overall societal well-being. Emphasizing the positive aspects of cultural identity and community development could resonate with this sentiment.

2. **Political Reflections and Criticisms:**
   - **Insight:** Acknowledge the varied perceptions of political leadership. A successful political candidate should aim to bridge gaps between different ideologies. Emphasizing a commitment to effective governance, transparency, and inclusivity, while distancing from negative aspects of dynastic politics, may appeal to a broader audience.

3. **Media and Political Transparency:**
   - **Insight:** Address concerns about media influence and political transparency by committing to open communication. Holding regular, unscripted press conferences, engaging with a diverse range of journalists, and promoting media freedom could build trust. Demonstrating a willingness to face tough questions shows accountability and transparency.

4. **Critique of Current Political Climate:**
   - **Insight:** Recognize the concerns about the current political climate and express a commitment to fostering a healthy democratic environment. A candidate should highlight a willingness to engage with the opposition constructively, ensuring that diverse voices are heard. Encourage civic participation and dialogue to strengthen democratic values.

5. **Diverse Perspectives on Political Figures:**
   - **Insight:** Acknowledge the diverse perspectives on political figures and refrain from divisive rhetoric. Focus on promoting positive attributes and policy goals, rather than engaging in personal attacks. Recognize the concerns of different segments of the population and present a vision that resonates with a wide spectrum of voters.

6. **Sociopolitical Observations:**
   - **Insight:** Understand and respect regional and cultural sentiments. Tailor policies to address specific concerns while emphasizing a broader national unity. Engage in inclusive dialogue to build bridges between communities. A candidate should be sensitive to diverse perspectives on issues like religion and ensure policies are equitable and inclusive.

Overall, a successful political candidate should prioritize openness, inclusivity, and accountability. Addressing the concerns raised in these perspectives can help build trust among voters and contribute to a more positive political discourse. It's essential to focus on shared values and aspirations to unite people under a common vision for a better future.","1. **Desire for Prestige and Validation:**

level 3rankaleefanclub Â· 2 days agoYes, at least on paper this central government is spending a lot on infrastructure whether directly or by inviting private players.The next thing all governments including local governments need to do is fix roads. Right now most highways are officially capped at 80kph and city roads at 40-60. On top of that, our roads, even newly paved ones, are laid haphazardly. Imagine getting a rocky ride when you are driving at 80-100kph, you would actually feel like you are losing control of your vehicle and slow down, if only because you don't want to destroy your car's suspension.Meanwhile you can drive safely at 160kph in western and central European roads. Indian trucks are often limited to 40-60kph, while trucks overseas regularly travel between 80 and 160kph in highways depending on the size. None of which is possible in India until road quality reaches those levels.21ReplyShareReportSaveFollow

You canâ€™t have big projects implemented over years with manual labor that takes China a fraction of the time to implement it. It would mean political suicide because that means killing jobs. So a path of training to operate the machines will be required.There needs to be standards and then trained regulators to enforce those with corruption rooted out. Thatâ€™s a tall order but would be needed if we expect any quality in our services.The country needs to also move away from ancient religious based traditions or religion all together.

India needs to bring everyone into the fold of a clear majority, banish the caste system for good, implement UCC or force convert everyone into the majoritarian religion or remove religion altogether, and have a cultural revolution to channelize the nationalist fervour. If these are successfully implemented, you will get the Chinese rate of growth. Otherwise, if you want that diversity and vibrancy, you have to make do with agitations, compromises and the time taken to obtain a collective consent. Then you will have an Indian rate of growth. Finding such middle grounds often requires corruption as a lubricant. Now it is up to us to decide what we want.1ReplyShareReportSaveFollow

Fund public infrastructure, fund public education, and improve the material living conditions of common everyday people.When people aren't struggling to make ends meet, they don't have to believe politicians lying and telling them that a particular community is their enemy. Because they can see that the ""enemy"" isn't actively harming them or their way of life, it's politicians and capitalists holding the working class by the throat to enrich themselves24ReplyShareReportSaveFollow
level 3Professional-Pea1922 Â· 2 days agoI understand the sentiment. Democracy is absolutely amazing and an authoritarian government should never be in place because they could always make disastrous policies that could completely trash flip the trajectory of a country( one Child policy).But at the same time I understand where the other comment is coming from. For better or worse China has some factors going for it that india frankly doesnâ€™t. If they want to build a infra project or something and ur land is required. You gotta give the land up with out much hassle. Yeah sure thereâ€™s probably instances where people made a fuss but your only kidding yourself if you donâ€™t think a majority of ppl really have a choice in giving up the land. And thereâ€™s also a thing with protests. Again for better or worse Indians have a habit of jist protesting for the sake of protesting. Some might be environmental activists while building a metro, some might be activists against nuclear plants, i mean whatever the case it holds the projects up that China never has to worry about.Another example is that recently there was that ceo dude that said Indians have to work 70 hrs to end up being a developed country or whatever. The dudes insane and ppl should absolutely not be forced to work that much at all, but china? They literally have a 9-9-6 policy. You gotta work 9 am to 9 pm for 6 days a week in manufacturing plants or where ever. We simply canâ€™t enforce that because weâ€™re a democracy. So again it all comes down to what you value. It doesnâ€™t exactly make sense to complain about how weâ€™re lacking behind China in certain aspects while not acknowledging the aspects where weâ€™re ahead (being a democracy) or some people consider that a weight that holds us back. All about perspective tbh.12ReplyShareReportSaveFollow

"Given the Role of US in Blatantly Supporting Israel...', Sandeep Pandey Returns Magsaysay Award","level 1rishianandOp Â· 16 hr. agoGandhian SocialistWhen I received the Magsaysay Award in 2002, a little controversy was created due to my decision to participate in a protest outside United States embassy in Manila against the impending attack on Iraq, immediately a day after the award ceremony in which the award was handed over by the Phillippines President.The then Chaiperson of Magsaysay Foundation had tried to dissuade me from participating in the protest on the pretext that itâ€™ll harm the reputation of the foundation. My contention was that the award mentioned my participation in a peace march in India for global nuclear disarmament from Pokaran to Sarnath in 1999 and hence my anti-war position was well known.I had to honour the decision taken at a peace conference at University in Manila which, coincidently, concluded on August 31, the day Magsaysay Awards were handed over, to stage a protest at US embassy, as I was invited to the conference as well. After the protest on 1 September, a Manila newspaper, in an editorial, challenged me saying that if I was the principled man that I would like them to believe then I should return the award to the US embassy before returning to India, This made the decision easier for me.I returned the cash component of the award from the airport which came from the Ford Foundation of the US but in a letter to the Chairperson of Magsaysay Foundation I said that for the time being I was keeping the award as it was named after a former popular Phillppines President and had been given in my country to personalities like Jayaprakash Narayan, Vinoba Bhave and Baba Amte, whom I considered as my ideals. I had mentioned in that letter that if the Magsaysay Foundation ever thought that I was harming their reputation too much, I would be happy to return the award as well.I think that the time has now come.Magsaysay Award is primarily funded by Rockefeller Foundation and the category in which I received the award is funded by Ford Foundation, both American foundations. Given the role of US in blatantly supporting Israel in the current offensive against Palestinian citizens, more than 21,500 of whom are dead, and still continuing to sell arms to Israel, it has become unbearable for me to keep the award. I, therefore, am deciding to finally return the award too.I would like to apologise to the people of Phillippines if they feel hurt because of President Ramon Magsaysayâ€™s name associated with this award. My protest is only because of the American connection with the award.As I return the Magsaysay award I also feel that I should relieve myself of the degrees I have obtained in US.Hence, I am also taking a decision to return my Dual M.S. degrees in Manufacturing and Computer Engineerings to Syracuse University in upstate New York and my Ph.D. in Mechanical Engineering degree to the University of California at Berkeley. Incidentally, I was made conscious of involvement of US academic institutions, especially their engineering and science departments, in defence projects during the protest on Berkeley campus in 1991 against the US war on Iraq launched by senior President Bush.A Professor Pravin Varaiya of Electrical Engineering, whose research area, Control Systems, was same as mine, and who was a participant in the anti-was protests, made me realize that I was also unknowingly part of the war machine of United States. Thus began my disillusionment with my research area and I decided to change my research area once I began teaching at Indian Institute of Technology at Kanpur in 1992.Again let me make it clear that I am not against the American people or even the country. In fact, I think the US is one country which respects the human rights the most and offers the best freedom of expression, but sadly it is true only within the country.Outside the US, it seems to have little regard for human rights, especially of the third world countries.If it respects justice then it should stand with the side facing oppression in any war. It took the correct position in the Russian war on Ukraine but when it comes to Israel against Palestine it is inexplicable why the US chooses to turn a blind eye to the misfortunes and sufferings of the Palestinians and overlooks the crimes of Israeli defence forces. Had it been any other country, it would have imposed sanctions against it, like it did along with the rest of the world against South Africa, when apartheid was still practiced there.I have to take the hard decision because I think US is singularly responsible in encouraging Israel to continue its aggression against Palestinians contrary to the popular world opinion. It could have played the role of mediator, like it once did, and tried to negotiate peace between Israel and Palestine. Creation of sovereign state of Palestine and its recognition by United Nations as a full member is essential towards the solution of the problem. But it is strange that US, which not very long back handed over Afghanistan, much bigger in area, to Taliban on a silver platter knowing very well that it was jeopardising the civil liberties of common Afghans, especially the women, parrots the Israeli position about Hamas being a terrorist organisation ignoring the fact that Hamas has won an election in Palestine, unlike the Taliban. I feel that it is time to call out the double standards of US government.Sandeep Pandey15ReplyShareReportSaveFollow
