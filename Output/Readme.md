This is a single csv file that has the output after gpt 3.5 reads the input from parser in the input folder. The name column has name of the discussion thread which for us our purpose is data1.csv, data2.csv etc.

The prompt can be seen in the gpt.py code and that was the basis to automate the process before I ran out of tokens.
