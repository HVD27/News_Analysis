0,After truck drivers' strike Govt agrees to discuss! Satish Acharya,"level 1AditiiSen · 4 hr. agoThis law is not a bad law at all. But the implementation is a major problem. Also, mob lynching is a problem. A country like India where it is always the fault of the bigger vehicle owner and where people randomly cross the road without checking left and right and definitely not the signals.In a country like India, you can't pass a law and expect it to change the people at once. Also, as Indians we need to change and do better if we expect our country to do better.The law passed is a step in the right direction but they need to also have provision if there is a mob ready to beat the driver then the driver can drive to a police station and surrender. That should be an acceptable situation as well.Also, make sure all the drivers have attained their license in the proper manner. Have better driving license test and a traffic police force who are actually there to maintain traffic and help people and not there to make money but showing their uniform.125ReplyShareReportSaveFollow

level 2charavaka · 1 hr. agoThis law is not a bad law at all.The law is terrible, if it doesn't make provisions for the ground realities you list, and more. The law as passed by the parliament without discussion is terrible, precisely because the parliament didn't take its time to discuss before passing the law, which is literally the main job of the parliament. This is the case for multiple laws in the 3 build that were passed, but only the laws that get massive protests are likely to be discussed and possibly fixed. We're doomed for years on others.4ReplyShareReportSaveFollow

level 3Ezvine · 5 hr. agoCan somebody tell me what the issue is here ? What is there to discuss ?Afaik, they have increased the penalty/imprisonment for hit and run cases, which is a good thing. And why the heck is truck drivers protesting against this ? Isn't this basically them saying that, they have been doing hit and run, and they want to continue doing it without any consequences ?Or is there something I'm missing here.33ReplyShareReportSaveFollow
level 4AditiiSen · 4 hr. agoThe only sane arguments here are:Mob lynching. Driver can't help in this situation and needs to get away. No one will sympathise with the driver if they hit a local. The truck drivers already have a bad rep.Corrupt Police. We all know how bad it is.So, the law is absolutely fine but needs to be implemented properly.31ReplyShareReportSaveFollow
level 5neeraj_agarwal · 1 hr. agoBajrang chawalOne more thing I'd like to add is if a truck and car collides fatality will almost always be in the car. How do you determine whose fault it is. Do you still convict the truck driver even if he doesn't run away?4ReplyShareReportSaveFollow
level 6AditiiSen · 1 hr. agoEven if the truck driver is innocent, he can be lynched and he would definitely be harassed by the authorities. Implementation is the harder thing.3ReplyShareReportSaveFollow
level 5fierze16 · 4 hr. agoEarthThis was pretty much true for the older laws too. Internal corruption has always been the problem and not the new/old laws. So bringing in new laws was always going to be just a PR act rather than any meaningful progress.7ReplyShareReportSaveFollow

level 8AditiiSen · 3 hr. agoAbsolutely.2ReplyShareReportSaveFollow
level 5charavaka · 1 hr. agoSo, the law is absolutely fine but needs to be implemented properly.You literally gave two reasons why the law is terrible, and then called out perfectly fine. Laws have to operate on the real world, not in ideal world. Ideal world doesn't need a law against hit and run. Real world does. And as such, th Needs to account for ground realities.2ReplyShareReportSaveFollow
level 6AditiiSen · 59 min. agoI think they made a law that mob lynching is punishable by death. Implementation is more on the Authorities and not the Government. A law passed without discussion is bad but with the number of hit and run cases, something needs to be done.It was just yesterday that a car hit the car behind me and almost hit my car while running away from the scene. I have provided my dashcam footage to the car driver behind me. Hopefully he will get deserved compensation.2ReplyShareReportSaveFollow
level 4Deathblade_311 · 4 hr. agoIt is a bit more grey than that. Most truck drivers don't have control on the load and the conditions of the vehicle and in most cases they become scape goats for trucking companies. So, improper cases will lead to much harsher punishment17ReplyShareReportSaveFollow
level 4mandatoryVoluntering · 3 hr. agoCM of IndiaIn addition to the reasons in sibling comment. There is also financial death caused by 7 lakhs fine. Which could also ruin their family. Might as well give them a choice between mob lynching or hanged till death for accidents.This is a fine(jurmana) govt. They have introduced so many fines on citizens aimed at making them very vulneralbe and compliant or life will be made more miserable.5ReplyShareReportSaveFollow

level 4HotIce7867 · 2 hr. agoI will say something which is purely according to what I have witnessed. I don't care about the parliament part right now but the truck drivers protesting is not out of nowhere. Truck drivers are far more vulnerable than we realise, a significant amount of trucks operate on roads which have dense traffic. And people in the road drive like that have 9 lives. Truck drivers are often killed or beaten up even if they are not at fault. So they have reason to be concerned. It did happen with our truck too and our driver was almost beaten up but was saved by others in the spot.1ReplyShareReportSaveFollow
level 2charavaka · 1 hr. agoNo. We're  mourning the death of our parliamentary democracy, and legitimisation of violence as political tool.2ReplyShareReportSaveFollow

level 1ImmediateDafuq · 3 hr. agoPeople are mindlessly protesting now. I know so many people who died after truck and bus drivers hit them and they go around with no punishments. This is a law taken in good step. Why is OP slandering with chaddi and all. If you have to use slang to prove a point , it’s disappointing. A cousin of my sister in law was hit when he was riding bike from behind by state bus. He was the only earning member of his family . His dad passed away and his mother is just alone . I saw a family breaking down . My sister in law was just insane for few days . There are multiple stories like this. Just see how state buses are driven. Like it’s a F1 race and roads are sprint circuit . Strict laws are a necessity.8ReplyShareReportSaveFollow
level 2rishianandOp · 3 hr. agoGandhian SocialistIncreasing punishment does not fix the issue. It's a fallacy.If you can fix a problem by increasing the penalty, then death penalty for rape would end the crime. That has never been the case. What's needed is a better addressal of the problem, so we can prevent accidents.What is most interesting is that neither the cartoon, nor my post, is against the law itself. I have said it again and again that the government refuses to discuss and communicate. Even if the law was good, then a debate in Parliament would clear doubts.5ReplyShareReportSaveFollow
level 2OnidaKYGel · 5 min. agoYes but the problem is that the trucking industry is based around very fast delivery. As long as unrealistic delivery targets exist, we will have hit and runs. A fine may reduce them a little, but not a lot.we need to improve the trucking industry.1ReplyShareReportSaveFollow

level 1rishianandOp · 6 hr. agoGandhian SocialistBharatiya Nyaya Samhita (BNS), along with Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita (BNSS) and Bharatiya Sakshya Act (BS), was passed in Lok Sabha on 20 December and in Rajya Sabha on 21 December, and received President's assent on 25 December 2023, to replace the Indian Penal Code, Criminal Procedure Code, and Indian Evidence Act. These critical bills saw little debate in the Parliament, which was forcibly captured by the ruling party after suspending 143 opposition members. BNS introduced several key changes to the penal code which would allow a de-facto Police Raj in the country, among other provisions.On January 1, protests against BNS broke off across the country from the transport workers. The workers were protesting against the increase in punishment and fine under the new law. The public and freight transport came to a halt. On January 3, MHA released a statement, saying that the newly passed Bhartiya Nyaya Samhita (BNS) has not yet come into effect, and the Government will hold discussions with the transport union regarding the contentious provisions.The entire episode is yet another example of the senseless and undemocratic policymaking under Modi Government. Modi Government has a colonial attitude towards India. They do not believe in any debate or discussion. They hold a dim view and understanding of parliamentary democracy. They routinely ignore the advice of scientists, academicians, and activists. They have little concern or care about common citizens. And they believe that increasing punishment or using force will fix any problem.From demonetization, to lockdown, to farm laws, to labour laws, to digital surveillance laws, to BNS, Modi Government has created a habit of taking senseless and undemocratic decisions and causing suffering for the common citizens and the nation. Had the policy been properly discussed and debated before, instead of discussing it after being passed, the strike could have been averted.Transport Worker's Strike and the Swift About-Face by the Modi Government is Yet Another Example of the Thoughtless and Undemocratic Policy Making Under this Regime-1ReplyShareReportSaveFollow

level 1rishianandOp · 2 hr. agoGandhian Socialist3 criminal laws are being discussed in Rajya Sabha. Amit Shah is present. Handful of opposition members left are asking for a response. Speaker is ignoring them. RSTV is only showing treasury benches.https://twitter.com/Memeghnad/status/1737757374243618823As truckers are protesting against the #HitandRunLaw, useful to remember that in the re-introduced version of Bhartiya Nyaya Sanhita 'causing death by rash and negligent act' attracted 5 years imprisonment for doctors as well (in cases of medical negligence).However, as per Home Minister Amit Shah's speech in #LokSabha, the Indian Medical Association managed to successfully undertake advocacy to get this reduced to two years, for which Home Minister moved official amendment just before the Bill was passed by LS.IMA had access to the Home Minister, Truckers are protesting on the street. In a #democracy, access to making and influencing law should be equitable and not restricted to a few elites.In fact, this is the reason that Standing Committees invite comments from public on Bills. But, the Home Affairs Standing Committee DID NOT invite comments on the three #criminalbills and rushed through with the process of scrutiny of the Bills. And ofcourse, the Bills were debated by both Houses in absence of most Opposition MPs, further reducing the possibilities of critical analysis.This is not how laws are supposed to be made!https://twitter.com/maadhyam/status/1742165710040932802?t=zSjSatOVmtG8tBJScVDgag&s=19264 questions raised by suspended Opposition MPs deleted from recordshttps://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/264-questions-raised-by-suspended-opposition-mps-deleted-from-records-101703272812489.html1ReplyShareReportSaveFollow
