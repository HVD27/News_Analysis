level 1Miserable_Goat_6698 · 1 day agoIt seems people have a hard on for hitting people on roads and running away?80ReplyShareReportSaveFollow
level 1Feisty_Interaction43 · 1 day ago · edited 1 day agoThe law is legit a good one. It emphasizes on the fact that if someone unintentionally runs over a pedestrian or is involved in an accident, then that person needs to help out the injured one by calling the police and taking them to the hospital instead of running away from the site and leaving them to die. Why is it so difficult to understand what’s good for a country and what’s not. This was one of the very rare occasions I actually agreed on something that BJP did, and there Congress is busy hitting a self goal. Congress should have sat this one out90ReplyShareReportSaveFollow

level 5DamonSchultz997 · 21 hr. agoEven funnier is mobs only care about what they see, the person who got hit could be the one in wrong but since he got hit and screaming murder no one will actually care about right or wrong after.People forgetting lynchings have been done on basis of assumptions of carrying beef or assumption of hurting/harassing someone. Only to be later found out that the person was innocent9ReplyShareReportSaveFollow
level 6hokagesamatobirama · 21 hr. agoJai Konoha, Uchiha Hai Hai!It is also funny that people assume that the mob cares about the injured. All they care about is, to quote a famous Hindi proverb, behti Ganga me haath dhona.6ReplyShareReportSaveFollow

level 4account_for_norm · 15 hr. agoThey are not even the same ppl! So much has changed since then!What a stupid argument. Emergency was mainly because of sanjaya nd indira. We had a million PMs since then and the country is different.Its like saying, Congress fought british, so now RaGa deserves to be PM. doesnt make any sense.4ReplyShareReportSaveFollow
level 5Megatron0003 · 15 hr. agoAre you saying RAGA will not fight on anything done by Congress in the past? Because from what I hear, it seems they still try to milk Nehru Indira legacy. If Congress can take credit for those why not Congress is responsible for Emergency? And the media is largely controlled by poll winners because they give advertisement, look for local language media where Congress had won or any other party is there. As I said BJP had learnt the trick of trade from Congress, congress just have lunatic at top and they don't dare to touch him0ReplyShareReportSaveFollow
level 6account_for_norm · 13 hr. agoHe may, but ppl should not vote for him for that history, in the same way ppl should not NOT vote for him for the history.Look at the present, him as a politician and make the decision. Not on the decisions of Indira, or Nehru.0ReplyShareReportSaveFollow
level 7Megatron0003 · 7 hr. agoOk, Why should anyone vote in the name of RaGa? What are his qualifications to be the congress leader. Never done any ground work. Don't have any understanding of ground reality. Both Kejriwal and RaGa are of same age. One has created his whole political party and defeated long standing duopoly in Delhi and Punjab. Meanwhile other has lost even the seat of amethi to an outsider.0ReplyShareReportSaveFollow
level 8account_for_norm · 2 hr. agoYou missed the point by miles.. are ppl getting dumber in india?? Let me spoon feed you.You are right, vote or dont vote raga for him, and with the same logic dont-dont vote him for 1977. Dont give him credit for 1947, and dont blame him for 1977.

level 3Megatron0003 · 1 day agoBJP never betrayed their core voter, that's the difference. That's why BJP core voters stand behind them time and again. And the top brass of the party doesn't belong to a family and its existence is not tied to a lineage.17ReplyShareReportSaveFollow
level 4DamonSchultz997 · 21 hr. agoForgetting Nupur Sharma? The one they threw out of the party because Muslim countries boycotted our products? No matter how you slice it that was a bad outlook for the party. People don’t like talking about it and for good reason. BJP has no defence against it.Even the bill they introduced which was brought in for “farmer’s benefit” was repealed after farmers protest and then the PM said it was repealed for “farmers benefit”. Again, no matter how you slice it, it looks bad on them.Also they have been pushing for reservations to win polls. Which again goes against their ideology where they believe jobs are taken through merit.They also claim to protect women and put them in the forefront of their ideology, but Brij Bhushan who has the POCSO act against him is still at large. Also the Bilkis Bano rapists were let go. There’s a lot to dissect when you actually look into their wrongdoings, It’s just that their fuck ups don’t make the news nearly as much as their success does. All in all, the party will bend over backwards towards anyone that’ll help them win the elections in the respective state, even if it goes against their ideology-3ReplyShareReportSaveFollow

level 1dontknow_anything · 1 day agoI think one thing that law misses is that there shouldn't be upper cap on the penalty. 7 lakhs for someone poor in an accident is too much, life changing, but for someone rich it is nothing. Put a lower limit (probably much lower than 7 lakhs, depending on the crime and context) and then make it depend on the net worth of a individual at max penalty.7ReplyShareReportSaveFollow

level 1HostileCornball · 1 day agoEarthI don't have a problem with this ruling but the government is trying to govern the transport mafia without actual implementation of labour laws or  of minimum wages for the drivers ever.

level 4akhandbharatvarshiOp · 1 day agoi believe mandatory dash cams on commercial vehicles will solve the problem as to determine whose fault it was , and regarding mob justice  yeah thats a problem that needs to be addressed but not by scrapping the law , indian truck drivers are very reckless on highways , dont follow lane rules , indicators , Right of Way principal and use the bigger vehicle size to outright bully smaller vehicles.8ReplyShareReportSaveFollow
level 5dontknow_anything · 1 day agoThere is already a law for mobs. Why does another crime stop increasing punishment for other crime?Mandatory dash cams solve nothing if there is the truck driver still does a hit and run.9ReplyShareReportSaveFollow
level 4BiggestPhallus · 1 day agoCase: You are moving at 60 kph on a 2 lane highway and a bike rams into your car, killing all bike riders on spot.According to this law,You are a criminal even though you were not at fault.You have to call emergency services ASAP.You have to go to jail or pay hefty fine. Even though you didn't commit any crime.If you stay on the spot, you will be beaten or at worst lynched.There are no witness to defend you as it was night, police doesn't care unless you bribe them, dashcams and CCTVs are non-existent.Now tell me why would a truck driver risk his life and not flee? He knows he will be lynched at worst and beaten like a dog at best. Police will file a case against him, ask bribes to close the case. He would have to be present in court even if he lives in a different state and has a job.0ReplyShareReportSaveFollow
level 5IINightMasterII · 1 day agoThak gaya huOkay, while I understand what you're trying to say. Would you rather flee from the accident spot where two people lost their lives?No matter if it was your fault or not, is fleeing really the solution here? Doesn't that make you look even more guilty?All the problems you mention are much bigger issues with the system that need to be solved one by one. I can completely understand the truck driver wanting to run away here, and I hate that I don't know the right answer to these problems, but fleeing from the scene doesn't really seem like the correct way.2ReplyShareReportSaveFollow
level 6BiggestPhallus · 1 day agoFleeing is unwarranted but in many such cases, the truck drivers are beaten to death only because their vehicle was bigger. Mob doesn't think logically (including the liberal mob on this sub) and make irrational and criminal decisions.These people believe that truck drivers enjoy killing people but that's not the case. Death is cruel and many truck drivers and loco poliots suffer from PTSD due to this. But truck drivers don't have the option to stay back and check the victims.7ReplyShareReportSaveFollow
