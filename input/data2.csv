level 6Conscious_Cut8882 · 22 hr. agoRight, but again, not quite. We who live in rural India all know what you mean, and I fully agree with what you were aiming at. But when you say lavish, I must disagree. Sure enough you will afford one employee for housekeeping and one for cooking if you like. But you are NOT going to drive a big Mercedes, or Audi or BMW, etc. Nothing comparable with the Mumbai billionaires' lifestyle. I reckon you know, my precision was more intended for the non Indian visitors on this Reddit (there are many), in order that they don't get a wrong impression.14ReplyShareReportSaveFollow

level 5BigWetRasogolla · 19 hr. agoUSA <-> West BengalYou know how much truck drivers in the US are paid? Mind that these people are the very hardworking and will do everything. American work hours are so less for themSo I actually grew up in the U.S. and worked for a transportation logistics company in college. Some truck drivers--especially those who own their own vehicles--can make well over $100,000 per year.However, the interstate trucking industry is actually quite well-regulated, both at the state level and at the federal level. Under most circumstances, it would be borderline impossible for an undocumented immigrant to obtain a commercial driver's license (CDL). And, for business owners, the risks of detection simply aren't worth the reward.Anyway, was just addressing the point about truck drivers. I get where you're coming from, but some of these seemingly ""low-skill, high-pay"" positions have higher (legal) barriers to entry than you'd probably expect.14ReplyShareReportSaveFollow

level 9bzbeer · 19 hr. agoBut an immigration court has to decide whether it is valid or not. Courts are backed up by 5-7 years. So in the meantime they get a temporary permit to stay and work in the US.By the time the court hearing rolls around, the person is established in the US, gets an attorney to plead the case.

level 6TheLastSamurai101 · 10 hr. agoThis is not how sanctuary cities/states work if that's what you're talking about. Sanctuary cities are just cities where the local police don't get involved in actively reporting or catching illegal immigrants or cooperate with operations against illegal immigrants. They argue that it is actually not their job to do so anyway, but legally the responsibility of the immigration authorities and federal police. The purpose is so that illegal immigrants aren't afraid to access things like legal, social, educational and health services for fear of deportation.Republicans have created this false narrative that santuary cities actively protect illegal immigrants from the immigration authorities, but that is not true. ICE can still operate freely within places like New York City, investigate however they like and catch whoever they want. It is just that the NYC police and the NY state police won't help them. But they certainly won't hinder them either.6ReplyShareReportSaveFollow
level 4BigWetRasogolla · 19 hr. agoUSA <-> West BengalEven with university or job you are stuck in H1B if you are Indian.It's really a battle, isn't it?I'm a U.S. citizen, and my wife is Indian. Even for people in our position, obtaining a visa isn't exactly easy. So far as I recall, it takes between 1.5 and 2.5 years from start to finish.I was lucky: our case met the Department of State's criteria for consular processing, and it was adjudicated in less than two months. But such requests are very rarely granted, and many families have to live separately--one spouse in India, the other in the U.S.--until all formalities have concluded.And then, on the other hand, I have Indian friends who don't have permanent residency after having spent between 10 and 15 years in the United States. One did his PhD in the U.S., has worked with two high-profile technology companies, and is still on his H1B. It's crazy.12ReplyShareReportSaveFollow

level 7BigWetRasogolla · 11 hr. agoUSA <-> West BengalSo consular processing itself isn’t very time-consuming —it’s all the formalities that come before and after.The worst step is, by far, the worst. Every immigrant visa application must be preceded by the submission of Form I-130. This application is sent to the United States and reviewed by U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, which makes a determination and forwards its decision to the Department of State.Processing times vary, with different USCIS field offices having wildly different averages. Some centers take a year, others take closer to two. It’s all luck (or lack thereof).After Form I-130 has been processed, it only takes another few months—up to a half-year—to complete all other formalities.My wife and I went through “direct consular filing,” or DCF. In DCF, the consulate itself reviews and adjudicates Form I-130 (along with the subsequent documentation that would typically be reviewed by the National Visa Center). Most of the time, DCF can be completed within a matter of weeks. Our case only took as long as it did because we were also planning our social wedding (we’d had a registry marriage the year before).However, very, very few people get to go through DCF. You have to meet specific requirements, and the decision to accept or deny a request is entirely at the consulate’s discretion.2ReplyShareReportSaveFollow

I mean if you have relatives bringing you back the same chocolates like Cadbury, kit kat etc you realise how bad it is. I'm lactose intolerant and the milk in India that you get in packets is so mixed that I don't even get a reaction. when I drink milk outside of India, i couldn't deal with it. its just yes, you can afford things but is that the best quality of things you could get? probably not.73ReplyShareReportSaveFollow
