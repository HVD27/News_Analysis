0,Transport Worker's Strike and the Swift About-Face by the Modi Government is Yet Another Example of the Senseless and Undemocratic Policy Making Under this Regime,"level 1Aggravating_Boy3873 · 15 hr. agoThe so called opposition should have a clear plan and actual solutions to India's problems if they want votes. My native place used to have 8-10 hour power cuts and everyone pretty much everyone was using groundwater for everyday use it changed to almost no power cuts, municipality pipeline to every house, garbage collection systems and plenty of other things. I am sorry and I dislike Modi too but unless somehow the public ignores all these developments in their neighborhood the opposition isn't gonna win. Maybe they should have done these things during their tenure because people aren't idiots, they can see these things happening around them.15ReplyShareReportSaveFollow

level 3Aggravating_Boy3873 · 7 hr. agoRural town in odisha called Bhawanipatna. It's in the KBK region, this whole region used to have sub saharan levels of poverty. I won't go into details about what congress used to let happen. My parents live in jharsuguda...which is like 300 kms away but it's out Bhawanipatna is our native place and they go there often. Jharsuguda got airport with connection to all major cities and our native place used to have famine to the extent people were dying in the streets during summer in early to mid 2000s. Policies regarding renewables, animal husbandry and agriculture transformed a whole lot of middle class. Everything is accessible including fibernet and smart classes in govt schools. Tribal children also get boarding houses with access to education while their parents get allowances.2ReplyShareReportSaveFollow
level 4TrueSonOfNoOne · 6 hr. agoIsn't that mostly due to Navneen Patnaik's work? Afaik he's not BJP or INDI Alliance.Also nice to see other people from KBK. I myself am not from there but I got a friend from Koraput.3ReplyShareReportSaveFollow
level 5Aggravating_Boy3873 · 6 hr. agoNaveen Patnaik has been in power for over 20 years but these places started developing after 2016. His party didn't really care about western odisha region until the centre started eyeing it for rare earth minerals recently.2ReplyShareReportSaveFollow

level 1ranbirkadalla · 6 hr. agoSenseless and undemocratic is correct. The way our democratically elected government has ceded to these terrorists on every step of the way is abhorrent. For once I hope we took a book out of other democratic nations and do to them what Canada did to the trucker protests-2ReplyShareReportSaveFollow"
