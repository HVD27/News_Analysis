level 2deepsmooch69 · 22 hr. agoMore than sanity, the PM post used to mean something. The nincompoop at the helm lies through his teeth everyday and wont stop at nothing, literally nothing in his quest for power. Even if he has to burn the whole bloody country down.98ReplyShareReportSaveFollow

level 1hydrosalad · 23 hr. agoIs there a point in having a press conference? Even if he holds one it will be sanitized to include only godi media, have preapproved questions and he will probably get a standing ovation.

level 2Your_Vader · 4 hr. agoUttra PrachandI still believe it's 80% congress' fault and only 20% BJPs doing. I can't believe they'd still impose Rahul Gandhi as the PM face when it's been proven so many times over and over that it's not going to work. There needs to be some fresh face with much more rigour and determination.It is the foolishness and nepotism of the congress party because of which the whole country has to suffer.0ReplyShareReportSaveFollow

I can't tell how often I've noticed the deep sadness and helplessness in his eyes - wanting to do so much more but not being able to because he has to keep the party happy.Maybe, just maybe, we would still have hum if he was unbound and did what he would have wanted to.1ReplyShareReportSaveFollow

level 3Inside-Office-9343 · 9 hr. agoYou seem to think that it’s some gotcha point. It’s not. It’s only natural they would field him as PM candidate in 2008. Let me ask you, if his reputation was that great, did he contest as an MP of the Loka Sabha? Why or why not?0ReplyShareReportSaveFollow
