You are Objectively wrong not subjectively.Corruption & Competence is not necessarily Mutually-Exclusive dynamic. One can grow & develop just fine while having Corruption.China's growth story included this.If you want to read more on this check out, China's Gilded Age: The Paradox of Economic Boom and Vast Corruption - by Yuen Yuen Ang. Or if you are short on time check 1-2 Podcasts she did on this book.Super Condensed TLDR.There are 2 types of Corruption (Access/Lobbying/Elite networking and Petty/low-level/bribing, etc).Post 2010s China's Mix of these 2 have flipped, they now have more Access Corruption than Petty Corruption. The above author gives Total Combined Corruption Index value of SAME to India China currently (even with different mixes now). But in reality its likely way way less in China (it takes while for non-Chinese research to align with reality on ground in China).3ReplyShareReportSaveFollow

level 3mumbaiblues · 1 day ago · edited 1 day agoYup , there is probably more corruption in China than India despite of executing many of those convicted of corruption. In India the corrupt are hardly ever convicted. But basic systems work in China , unlike India . Opening a factory in India vs China its day and night difference. Basic civic amenities  , high speed trains are vastly better in China than in India.Main reason is Chinese political leaders  have a laser focus goal on making China the worlds number one economy. While Indian leaders and people who elect them have other priorities like religion caste , etc.20ReplyShareReportSaveFollow

level 4ExpressResolution435 · 1 day agosorry but the farm laws were SHIT!... not to put too fine a point the laws they were written by corporate for the corporate ...it was basically just land grab. while the old laws required a re think ramming it down the peoples throat was not a  way to go. there was absolutely no debate on the laws they weren't even willing to listen to reasonable suggestions...the problem is that Mr modi seems to think he and only he has the right vision of india and that anyone who opposes him and his grandiose vision are anti him anti india. we pay a price for narrow minded autocratic assholes in power who have no idea about policy ..they think policy is too complex and everything should be written in two lines as a diktat.The problem with that is the people down the line also try to the same thing call it DM's IAS officers ...and since we are talking about growth you cannot have growth on the backs of high taxation and 100% debt. its a recipe for disaster (look at south america). oh btw giving 80cr people food subsidy also wipes out any gains that you might get through high taxation. and if you didnt give thos 80cr people food subsidy a lot of them would have dies of hunger go back to to the 50s and 60s .... thats how deep a hole we have dug for ourselves but all we can sing our peons of mr modi and his policy of green flaggin vande bharats.9ReplyShareReportSaveFollow

level 3rankaleefanclub · 2 days agoYes, at least on paper this central government is spending a lot on infrastructure whether directly or by inviting private players.The next thing all governments including local governments need to do is fix roads. Right now most highways are officially capped at 80kph and city roads at 40-60. On top of that, our roads, even newly paved ones, are laid haphazardly. Imagine getting a rocky ride when you are driving at 80-100kph, you would actually feel like you are losing control of your vehicle and slow down, if only because you don't want to destroy your car's suspension.Meanwhile you can drive safely at 160kph in western and central European roads. Indian trucks are often limited to 40-60kph, while trucks overseas regularly travel between 80 and 160kph in highways depending on the size. None of which is possible in India until road quality reaches those levels.21ReplyShareReportSaveFollow

Something as simple as airline boarding requires 4 different people looking at your ticket.I still don’t get the point of cumbersome extra steps like OTP for everything.Infrastructure is important but reliance on modern machine driven construction is key for that. You can’t have big projects implemented over years with manual labor that takes China a fraction of the time to implement it. It would mean political suicide because that means killing jobs. So a path of training to operate the machines will be required.There needs to be standards and then trained regulators to enforce those with corruption rooted out. That’s a tall order but would be needed if we expect any quality in our services.The country needs to also move away from ancient religious based traditions or religion all together. There’s endless bickering on stupid things which you can also see taking countries like the US back with their far right Christian nuts in power. Even MBS saw how the Islamic Religious Police were holding back progress in modernizing Saudi Arabia and severely curtailed their power.2ReplyShareReportSaveFollow

China is 92% Han Chinese who are irreligious or mildly religious. India needs to bring everyone into the fold of a clear majority, banish the caste system for good, implement UCC or force convert everyone into the majoritarian religion or remove religion altogether, and have a cultural revolution to channelize the nationalist fervour. If these are successfully implemented, you will get the Chinese rate of growth. Otherwise, if you want that diversity and vibrancy, you have to make do with agitations, compromises and the time taken to obtain a collective consent. Then you will have an Indian rate of growth.

Democracy is absolutely amazing and an authoritarian government should never be in place because they could always make disastrous policies that could completely trash flip the trajectory of a country( one Child policy).But at the same time I understand where the other comment is coming from. For better or worse China has some factors going for it that india frankly doesn’t. If they want to build a infra project or something and ur land is required. You gotta give the land up with out much hassle. Yeah sure there’s probably instances where people made a fuss but your only kidding yourself if you don’t think a majority of ppl really have a choice in giving up the land. And there’s also a thing with protests. Again for better or worse Indians have a habit of jist protesting for the sake of protesting. Some might be environmental activists while building a metro, some might be activists against nuclear plants, i mean whatever the case it holds the projects up that China never has to worry about.Another example is that recently there was that ceo dude that said Indians have to work 70 hrs to end up being a developed country or whatever. The dudes insane and ppl should absolutely not be forced to work that much at all, but china? They literally have a 9-9-6 policy. You gotta work 9 am to 9 pm for 6 days a week in manufacturing plants or where ever. We simply can’t enforce that because we’re a democracy. So again it all comes down to what you value. It doesn’t exactly make sense to complain about how we’re lacking behind China in certain aspects while not acknowledging the aspects where we’re ahead (being a democracy) or some people consider that a weight that holds us back.

level 4LifesPinata · 2 days agoChina's form of economy is 'Socialism with Chinese Characteristics'Communism, and by extension, Global Communism is still far into the future; centuries probably. Socialism is the stage of societal development before Communism.Their mode of economy isn't traditional socialism the way Marx imagined, but that's what Lenin's concept of Dialectical materialism aimed to explain. The PRC could never have survived Western powers descending on it and doing everything they can to destabilize it, the way it did to the USSR. That's why the market reforms introduced by Deng were opposed by Mao.Though the debate remains whether the PRC is socialist (or in socialist movement, if you want to argue theory) or capitalist, it's undeniable that the PRC is the only country not a part of the imperial core that managed to bring over 600m people out of poverty and build infrastructure rivaling the West, while still growing economically4ReplyShareReportSaveFollow

level 4iVarun · 1 day agoSee latest Gini and Adjusted Gini data. And in trendlines it's even more clear.TLDR, Chinese Gini based Inequality is declining post 2015 when Party announced pivot to how their Economy will be structured. That process of ongoing.When Deng said, Some will get rich before others, that is what happened. He didn't say those who become rich earlier will remain THE ONLY ones to be rich.The to pivot already started. Those who read Western sources about China don't get this. But they will, a decade later when reality is too hard to ignore and rhetoric is feeble.0ReplyShareReportSaveFollow

level 1zafar_bull · 1 day agoI just read yesterday how NDMC in Lutyens Delhi wanted to remove Sunheri masjid to put traffic signals even though their own report a couple of years back had said that it is not required.However, these same people can't put up simple zebra crossing or traffic lights in lots of areas of Delhi causing daily accident and traffic bottlenecks.Hence, as long as ruling elites are happy, nothing is going to change in this country.1ReplyShareReportSaveFollow

level 1frozen_mercury · 23 hr. agoRoads. India has no rules when it comes to traffic. Upper class doesn't care because they never drive themselves. Lower class doesn't drive, unless they are drivers. Middle class is forever stuck in traffic, trying to avoid rikshaw, cycle, trucks and cows/dogs, and even incoming traffic on one way streets.Everything that requires physical movement because of this. People die because doctors/ambulances can't reach hospital in time.Fixing this problem isn't even hard. Existing roads are sufficient. Enforcing rules is what is required.1ReplyShareReportSaveFollow

Human rights which are denied by our parents and families and society as a whole everyday? Rampant SA and misogyny? The gutter our air is?? Population control? Millions hungry and dependent on ration?1ReplyShareReportSaveFollow"
