level 190mlPeg Â· 1 day agoI see not a single pros regarding installing modiâ€™selfie booth at stations.Even if they put Vande bharat selfie points or advertised facilities travellers can avail it would have been worth the money. But 1-2crores to advertise Modi is just an election stunt nothing else.Sad to see hardworking bureaucrats being transferred for conveying correct information to public.28ReplyShareReportSaveFollow
