She opened schools for girls, and shelters for widows fighting against sati. Today, marks her 193rd birth anniversary","level 1AutoModeratorMod · 1 day ago · Stickied commentLockedHey r/India!

level 1BiggestPhallus · 1 day agoChaddis being the shameless creatures they are, have now started accusing Savitribai of pimping her school's girl students to British officers. Such is their hatred for lower castes and anybody criticising their feelthy religion.16ReplyShareReportSaveFollow
level 2yotsuya94 · 1 day agoIt was a guy called TrueIndology that had made that claim on Twitter and the funny thing is he was arrested by the BJP government itself and apologised too. What a bunch of jokers 😂10ReplyShareReportSaveFollow
level 2Direct-n-Extreme · 21 hr. agotheir feelthy religion.When you attack the religion instead of the political ideology, you will only drive more people from that religion to that political ideologyNot to mention, in this instance the proponents of said political ideology themselves rejected the words said against Phule by one fringe individualFinally it is basic decency to not throw insults towards any faith, constrictive criticism doesn't involve hatred and usage of slurs.0ReplyShareReportSaveFollow
level 3anamika_3 · 20 hr. agoActually considering Phules were against the religious ideology in question, it's  not strange. People of that religion have been like that, and worse without any criticism. You can't blame people who have disrespect for ideology which oppressed them for millenia4ReplyShareReportSaveFollow
level 4Direct-n-Extreme · 20 hr. agoPeople of that religion have been like that, and worse without any criticism.That is nothing but a blatant racist/xenophobic generalisationYou can't blame people who have disrespect for ideology which oppressed them for milleniaBy this logic, so called Sanghis can't be blamed for any hateful or bigoted comment against Islam/muslims either.By the same logic do all Indians get the right to hate on and be racist against Britishers today?Actually considering Phules were against the religious ideology in questionThe likes of Savarkar and even Ambedkar had similar thoughts regarding a certain particular religion, as such again, does that mean the followers of those two have the right to hate and shit on those thier leaders despised almost a century ago?0ReplyShareReportSaveFollow
level 5anamika_3 · 20 hr. ago//generalisation//facts, data sab gaya G marane. Go read the scriptures. Or the current data. Caste census toh kabhi karane nahin wale.Second, how dare you take sanghi apologist savarkar name with Ambedkar? One was a UC hater whose only contribution was proving how useless sanghis are. Ambedkar on the other hand, was a humanist who criticised everything logically. It's not out of hate or spite. He found all these religions illogical and he said so.4ReplyShareReportSaveFollow
level 6Direct-n-Extreme · 20 hr. agoThe point I'm making is just because a leader criticised a religion, it doesn't give the followers of said leader to blatantly hate and throw insults against that faith. As doing so does nothing but perpetuate the cycle of hatredAmbedkar ""criticised"" Islam in the same manner as Hinduism, so does an Ambedkarite hating and throwing insults against Islam and muslims would be acceptable for you?Same goes for the oppression argument. Throughout history, most groups of humans have oppressed and have been oppressed by one anotherSo does that give people in the present day to hate, discriminate and worse, be violent against the descendants of some group which oppressed thier ancestors?-1ReplyShareReportSaveFollow
level 7anamika_3 · 19 hr. agoSanghis don't have brains, and can't even pretend, no matter how much they try. Ambedkar didn't insult islam/muslims. He criticised Islam and never hated muslims. You'd have known that IF you'd read that criticism.That's the major difference, sanghis like savarkar can never do that.Oppressed people don't ask for the right to oppress, that's only the privileged group's imagination, like men think feminists will enslave them, etc. Oh btw muslims, first even the Persians, mughals, they're invited by Hindu rulers to fight their wars. Second, most of the muslims have no part in oppression of Hindus. They're converts, some willing some forced. The ruling aristocrats btw they're still way better off, and don't face that level of discrimination. Even the most RW leaders suck up to them, very nicely. Just see how cosy yogi modi are w Arabs. On the other hand ALL upper castes did oppress, harass, marginalised lower castes.1ReplyShareReportSaveFollow

level 2Knighthawk_2511 · 1 day agoAntarcticaAny proof ? Like some evidence and all ? Savitribai was a pioneer for women education because our people didn't sent women or girls to school just due to gender issues which were protested by this couple.Ik for people like MK Gandhi and other bhure sahebs but savitribai wasn't one one of them so wasn't jyotiba , instead Mahatma Jyotiba phule was the one who revived the writing of Chatrapati Shivaji Maharaj's history he found out the samadhi of Maharaj on Raigad .British declared its a crime to even take the name of Shivaji Maharaj among soldiers as they feared that by merely taking Maharaj's name would end up chaos for Brits .If Jyotiba's work meant the shudra and caste concept with missionary goals , then he wouldn't be damned about all this.There are books like 'rise of the maratha power' written by MG Ranade which even though countered some points of colonell todd's book but has some fake history when it came to sambhaji Maharaj (might be due to the lack of historical evidence back then)3ReplyShareReportSaveFollow"
