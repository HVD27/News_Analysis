0,BJP win in India’s 2024 general election ‘almost an inevitability’,"level 1lonelytunes09 · 9 hr. agoWhile the the article talks about Hindutva only, BJP's core voter base of Hindutva(who vote for Hindutva alone) is not more than 15-20%. A major part of the voter is the beneficiary of social benefit schemes. While most of the people on social media and these journalist are well to do, people do not realize how a small benefit like gas cylinder, tap water or toilet is to people who are living below or close to the poverty line.Also what differentiates modi from other leaders is the scale at which feedback is collected and branding is done. While media and this ads are visible, these are very low contributors to the popularity. The major contributors are the karyakartas on the ground who are in touch with people and spend their time communicating one-to-one. The biggest example is GST. While BJP's core voter base is termed as brahman, baniya i.e. trader and upper caste community, they took courageous decision of implementing GST which Congress could not do for the fear of losing support from cash cows. There was a back lash from the business community however, even the opposition could not expose this fault line because BJP had ears to the ground and agility to adapt to the changes.This is the difference between BJP and Congress. While BJP hammers on every faultline of Congress, Congress expects that BJP faultline to be exposed on their own. There is a phrase in my mother tongue which roughly translates to 'if there is god, I would get food even lying on my bed' and that is the general attitude of Congress.123ReplyShareReportSaveFollow
level 2chiguy_1 · 2 hr. agoWait, BJP is winning because of ""social benefit schemes""? But don't BJP supporters rage against freebies day and night? So are freebies good or are they bad?Plus, the claim about their core voter base being only 15-20% hindutva is not correct. If it was so, why is the government preparing to demolish mosques in Varanasi and Mathura? Why is demolishing people's houses celebrated? Why are riots being conducted in Manipur? Why does BJP give tickets to more and more extremists in every state?In Karnataka elections, BJP fought elections on the sole issue that ""Congress insulted lord Hanuman. We will win elections because lord Hanuman is with us."" If their core hindutva vote bank is only 15-20%, why did they fight elections solely on this issue?8ReplyShareReportSaveFollow
level 3lonelytunes09 · 53 min. agoThere is a stark difference between freebie and social benefit scheme and the difference is targeted social benefit to the beneficiary.While giving free electricity to people who can pay for it achieves no social benefit but giving free bus rides to women them mobility and ability to earn for themselves and family.Now the second part is ensuring the social benefit is given to the right beneficiary by penetrating several corrupt inefficient beareaucratic layers. Modi takes credit for that. All the while kcr had best social benefit programmes from cradle to grave however, people complained that they did not receive the benefits.Hindutva is just a common platform for interaction as I had given an example earlier. The business class would had pulled the rug under BJP's feet had they not addressed their concerns of GST. In such a case no appeal for sake of Hindutva will work. In my experience an uneducated poor man is more savvy and informed of politics than an educated person because there is an existential crisis which hinges on his vote. He might listen to you on the Hindutva agenda but will only vote if you address his concerns.5ReplyShareReportSaveFollow
level 2deepsmooch69 · 6 hr. ago · edited 6 hr. agoI am sorry but for all of these strengths, by far the biggest strength of BJP is how they have destroyed institutions who are supposed to keep a check on the power. As a result they are literally free to do whatever they like - they can spin the news however they like because the media is pliant, and because the media is plaint BJP makes sure that the agency which is supposed to keep a check on the news channels does not do its job, they can offer plum rajya sabha position to retiring judges - a clear conflict of interest and would be unacceptable in any other half decent working democracy, they have legitimised opaque funding in the form of electoral bonds from crony corporates and gets a lion share of political donations, the public does not know who donated and why,  they might loose state elections but on the back of central investigating agencies and sheer money power topple a democratically elected state government and change it to BJP, centrally appointed LG's in various non BJP state governments have been known to disrupt the state government's working, if the highest court disagrees with constitutional authority overreach by LG and returns a judgement in favor of the state government such as in Delhi, an ordinance is passed with in a week which renders a democratically elected government with no powers what so ever, they control the social media narrative by intimidating social media companies so the truth literally has no space to come out, they force alliance with the same people they called anti nationals or deeply corrupt and all of that is forgotten when they join BJP, the opposition and the common man has literally no voice left in the media in India so while it is easy to blame opposition for not doing enough, the fact is that they just cannot. I can go on and on but give this amount of power to any party, even a brand spanking new party and you will see their performance in elections.The worse part is not even that BJP is doing all of this and getting away, the worse part is that this will become a template for being in power in the times to come in India. Please go back in time and see how our politics has bascially gone down hill successively every 5 years - from ruthlessly honest Lal Bahadur Shastri to Election commission which had the balls to call of Indira Gandhi's election or the erstwhile BJP government which lost lok sabha election because of onion prices, we have seen the power of pulbic erode in Indian democracy. Now we are literally left with no power and there is no one else to blame other than the public itself. Rant over29ReplyShareReportSaveFollow

Congress still has the 2000s mentality of politics, while the bjp has shifted the paradigm from the coalition based one from the 90s back to the massive single party one today.

Which the opposition should be taking up in a healthy democracy.Democracy is in peril, that does not mean welfare schemes and developments in certain sectors are not happening. Certain sections of society are getting their needs and aspirations fulfilled.But my intuition says that this development is lopsided and will come at a huge cost for India. In the coming years there could be revolts and political upheaval.There is a threshold to fake sense of identity that nationalism can provide and religion cannot feed a hungry stomach.Opposition owes to the citizens, if they don't stand up for people, people will stand up for themselves and that will be unmanageable and angry force. It will get ugly if not managed.And if that happens then a weak opposition that didn't stand with the people would be at fault.-1ReplyShareReportSaveFollow
level 2iVarun · 3 hr. agoWhat you laid out is Logistics. And Logistics are Capital/Resource intensive as a direct-function.You can overcome ""Near"" asymmetry on this vector with your peer using various innovations/strategies but NOT extreme overhead asymmetry.That is what happened to Indian Politics over 2010s. The Political wave that was there in early 2010s got strengthened even further when this Resource intensive vector got acquired by the Incumbemt.In macro terms (& historic when it will be written about decades from now), Opposition actually has punched ABOVE its weight & capacity given the scale & scope of asymmetry and challenges. What one should/would have expected is INC to be in single-digit vote & seat shares or 0 (as the Intention, even xyz-mukt-bharat messaging explicitly was) but it's not, objectively so.Until 2021-22, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) was the biggest beneficiary of electoral bonds, receiving Rs 5,272 crore in donations or 57% of the total value of bonds, according to data from the Association of Democratic Reforms (ADR). The Congress received the second highest amount of Rs 952 crore (10% of the total amount)Rs 16,000 crore in 6 years: Electoral bonds spiked ahead of key elections.It's pretty simple, UNLESS one wants it to be bending over backwards mental gymnastics complicated for whatever reasons.3ReplyShareReportSaveFollow

I too dislike what’s happening at the center, especially the weakening of institutions and fabric of societyBut, the common man feels more secure with Modi at the helm. They feel something is happening and unquestionably the infra push beats any government of the past (physical and digital infra)As far as UP is concerned, the BJP is outright better than SP/ BSP. Be it the higher society in Noida or the daily wager in my tier 2 hometown - all are happier per my interactions.Even Ram Mandir which is so controversial (and the pomp is annoying me) is still a huge win.

I am sorry and I dislike Modi too but unless somehow the public ignores all these developments in their neighborhood the opposition isn't gonna win. Maybe they should have done these things during their tenure because people aren't idiots, they can see these things happening around them.I agree there is a lot of marketing involved with this govt and quite a lot of missteps but when people actually see roads being built in remote areas, low income social housing projects and agricultural incentives people in non urban areas specifically will vote the center.

On media part also there are network who works for congress and network that works for BJP as well. The propaganda is also similar for both of the party. In simple terms BJP is delivering what they promised in their election manifesto and because of this they are winning. Congress needs a new face. RaGa is not capable of making Congress win even after x number of relaunch.2ReplyShareReportSaveFollow

level 1oblivious_human · 10 hr. agoMaybe the idea of this and similar articles (and comments) that will come in the next few days is to further discourage any opposition.Most of the ""absence"" of opposition is because the media doesn't let you see any opposition.-2ReplyShareReportSaveFollow

level 2the_storm_rider · 4 hr. agoI wish this were true, but it’s not. There really is no competent opposition. You can state all the facts and figures you want, it will still not compensate for the fact that the opposition is lazy and has no motivation to win. All they do is virtue-signalling all day. It’s like Microsoft saying you should buy windows phone instead of iPhone  because it consumes less battery. No one cares. Now with the nyay yatra at least they are putting in some effort, and it is likely to pay off with some additional seats. And combining with regional parties they might stand a chance. But at this point it’s more likely to be the status quo.7ReplyShareReportSaveFollow
